Aberration is an FPS horror sci-fi game made in Unity. Hunt down monsters known as _Aberrants_ to keep the peace of a nearby town and the ecosystem.

This game was made for our final project on one of our subjects. This project aims to create a digital game, choosing from one of many genres using necessary and appropriate game scripts. We as a team, agreed on the shooting genre as we want to experience developing a first-person shooter.
